What happens when you type google.com in your browser and press Enter?


The Gateway to Unlocking the Web: Internet Secrets Revealed 

Everybody loves secrets, and I've got a "web secret" to share. Lean in, but shhh... this is just between us, pinky promise? 

Ever wondered what happens when you type a URL like https://www.google.com and hit Enter? Let me unravel the mystery for you. 

Firstly, let's handpick and explain the layers of technology that seamlessly connect your browser to the vast realms of the internet, making your requested webpage appear like magic:

DNS Request 

Our journey begins with the Domain Name System (DNS) request. DNS acts as a digital phonebook, translating human-readable domain names into machine-readable IP addresses. Why? To convert your human-readable requests into computer language, ensuring the right IP address is fetched when you type a URL like www.google.com. 

TCP/IP

Once converted to an IP address, your computer initiates a Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) connection. TCP ensures reliable, ordered data transfer, orchestrating a seamless flow of information between your computer and the server. 

Firewalls

Firewalls stand as vigilant guardians, filtering your requests before reaching the server. These digital security defenders regulate all incoming and outgoing network traffic, ensuring no unauthorized access and keeping your data secure. 

HTTPS/SSL

Online security takes center stage with HTTPS, an extension of HTTP. It offers a secure connection through Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) or its successor, Transport Layer Security (TLS), encrypting data as it travels between your browser and the server, safeguarding it from potential eavesdroppers. 

Load Balancer

Popular websites handle massive traffic, and load balancers distribute incoming requests across multiple servers. This balancing act ensures no single server becomes overwhelmed, enhancing website reliability and responsiveness. 

Web Server 

Your request, having passed through the load balancer, arrives at the web server. This software piece listens to your request, fetches the desired data or web page, and uses the established TCP connection to send it back to your browser. 

Application Server

For dynamic websites needing more than static content, an application server comes into play. It processes database queries, business logic, and other operations involved in creating dynamic content, returning the processed data to the web server. 

Database

The journey concludes with the database server, the final destination for websites using databases to store and retrieve data. Messages are exchanged between the application server and the database server, ensuring the requested content is retrieved or updated before reaching the user. 

Conclusion

The journey from typing a web address to seeing the webpage involves intricate steps.Every time you hit Enter, the internet works magically because of these processes. It's a digital symphony at its finest.
