## Task 0: Gather data from an API
Old-school system administrators usually only know Bash, but this task involves building Python scripts to access employee data via a REST API. The script accepts an employee ID as a parameter and displays their TODO list progress.

```bash
python3 0-gather_data_from_an_API.py <employee_id>
```

## Task 1: Export to CSV
Extends the previous task to export data in CSV format. The script records all tasks owned by the specified employee.

```bash
python3 1-export_to_CSV.py <employee_id>
```

## Task 2: Export to JSON
Extends the previous task to export data in JSON format. The script records all tasks owned by the specified employee.

```bash
python3 2-export_to_JSON.py <employee_id>
```

## Task 3: Dictionary of list of dictionaries
Extends the previous task to export data in JSON format for all employees. The script records all tasks from all employees.

```bash
python3 3-dictionary_of_list_of_dictionaries.py
```
