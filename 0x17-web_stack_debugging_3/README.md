# Puppet Fix for Apache 500 Error

This Puppet module (`0-strace_is_your_friend.pp`) is designed to resolve the Apache 500 Internal Server Error. The issue is diagnosed using `strace`, and the fix is implemented using Puppet.

## Problem Description

When making a request to Apache (`curl -sI 127.0.0.1`), a 500 Internal Server Error is returned. This indicates a problem with the Apache server.

## Diagnosis with `strace`

To find the root cause of the issue, `strace` is used to trace system calls and signals. This helps identify where Apache encounters an error and returns a 500 status.

```bash
strace -p <apache_process_id>
```

## Puppet Fix

Puppet is used to automate the fix for the identified issue. The Puppet code is included in the `0-strace_is_your_friend.pp` file.

```puppet
# 0-strace_is_your_friend.pp

# Puppet code to fix Apache 500 Internal Server Error

# Define an exec resource to implement the fix
exec { 'fix-apache-error':
  command     => 'your_command_to_fix_apache', # Replace with the actual command
  refreshonly => true,
}

# Include additional Puppet resources or manifests as needed
# ...

```

## Applying the Puppet Fix

To apply the Puppet fix, use the following command:

```bash
puppet apply 0-strace_is_your_friend.pp
```

This will execute the Puppet code and implement the necessary changes to resolve the Apache 500 error.

## Verification

After applying the fix, make a request to Apache (`curl -sI 127.0.0.1:80`) and ensure that a 200 OK status is returned instead of the previous 500 error.

```bash
curl -sI 127.0.0.1:80
```

## Example Output

```bash
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
